# Getting started


## Clone from git 

Repo: https://github.com/ixianslab/srh-data-science


## Build conda environment

Run the command `conda env create -f environment.yml` to install the conda env named `srh`.

To activate the environment run `conda activate srh`.

To deactivate the environment run `conda deactivate`.


## Development of new content

### Git branches 
We work with branches. Our naming convention for a branch is `kapitel_XXX_name`. The current deployed version in the srh moodle environment is
on the branch `srh-script`. 

### Folder structure
Add new folders such as `Kapitel_CLT` in the `./notebooks` folder so that we get a reliable structure.

The repository should have the following structure:

    repo-name
    ├── _experimental        # Stuff that never made it but is too valuable to be deleted ;-)   
    ├── .git                 # Git internals, don't mess around here.
    ├── .gitignore           # Specifies files and folders that should be ignored by git.
    ├── environment.yml      # The requirements file for reproducing the analysis environment in conda. 
    ├── notebooks            # Find all Jupyter notebooks here.
    │   └── Kapitel_00       # Serves as a template. Copy and paste this folder to get staretd
    │   │   └── _img         # Rendered images/pdfs/videos within notebooks are placed here.
    │   └── Kapitel_xxx      # Any topic of interest
    │   │   └── _img         # Rendered images/pdfs/videos within notebooks are placed here.
    │   └── ...              # Find all Jupyter notebooks here.
    │       └── _img         # Rendered images/pdfs/videos within notebooks are placed here.│   
    ├── README.md            # README for using this project.
    ├── references           # Scientific papers, links, manuals, and all other explanatory materials.
    ├── reports              # Generated analysis as HTML, PDF, LaTeX, etc.
    │   └── figures          # Generated graphics and figures to be used in reporting.
    └── src                  # Source code for use in this project.
        ├── __init__.py      # Makes src a Python module.
        └── notebook_env.py  # A file with basic settings when working with Jupyter notebooks.
        
## Build a jupyter book

AN **HTML version** of the book can be built using the following command:

`jupyter-book build notebooks/` 

Make sure that you are in the right directory so that `notebooks/` yields to the place where the `_config.yml` and `_toc.yml` are found. 
Then, after the successful build you can find the hmtl files in `repo-name/notebooks/_build/html/`. If you want to build individual chapters you need to specifiy a `_config.yml` and `_toc.yml` within each chaptes directory. 

A ***PDF version*** of the book can be built with the following command:

`jupyter-book build notebooks/ --builder pdfhtml`

This builds a pdf version from the previously created html files by emulating a browser (chromium).After the build completes, the pdf can be found in `repo-name/notebooks/_build/pdf/`
 
## Push to repo
`ghp-import -n -p -f notebooks/_build/html`
